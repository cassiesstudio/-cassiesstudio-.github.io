Summary

Title: Satisfaction Evaluation Report About Course 3
Student number: 1918053

Introduction:

Student satisfaction is very important for a school, in that case,
my research question is about the class evaluation based on Turkiye student dataset. 

Before I use d3 to represent these graphs, I used python to do some statistics to obtain data needed.
And when I explore the dataset, I use code to make sure that the dataset contains no missing data, so
it seems good to go.

I begin by asking which class has the most active student. 
The student enrolled in that class will give the most response to the class. 
One problem with this is that the classes don't necessarily to have same amount of student. 
But, for now, I assume that they do. 
And take the class with the most responses as an example to analysis satisfation.
I think such analysis results may be more targeted.

Main results, discussion:

The students with the most neutral attitude are the most, and the satisfaction of course 3 is average. 
It is worth noting that there are more highly dissatisfied students than more highly satisfied ones. 
Through reason analysis, I found that there are also such satisfaction trends in these three indicators, 
especially in the first two factors. 
So I assume that for some students, 
it may be that those students who are lagging behind in language or other learning abilities do not receive corresponding help from school, 
resulting in dissatisfaction with the course. This is where the school should pay attention, especially on question 1, 
the number of unsatisfied people is more prominent, 
and the follow-up can be improved on this issue to allow more students to have a good experience.
The overall teaching satisfaction of the school is moderate, and the teacher's performance has been more recognized by students.

Conclusion:

I have categorized the problem. I think this analysis is more specific and instructive. 
Schools can know in what areas they are doing well and in what areas they need to improve. 
The next thing I want to do is to analyze the data set completely, this time only the satisfaction of one course is analyzed.
